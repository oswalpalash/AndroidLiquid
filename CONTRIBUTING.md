## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the project and then git clone it using one of two commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/AndroidLiquid.git
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/AndroidLiquid.git
```
2. Make your edits then compile the project to check for errors. We do not use CI tests, but might be in the future.

3. Then submit a pull request here detailing what you have done and if @oswalpalash decides that it fits with the project, then your pull request will be merged.
